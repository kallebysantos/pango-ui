## Introduction

Pango UI is a [Shadcn/UI](https://ui.shadcn.com) inspired component registry for Blazor. It provides beautifully designed and accessible components that you can copy directly into your project, giving you **complete ownership** and **control over your UI**.

## Why Pango?

### The Problem with Traditional Component Libraries

Most UI libraries for Blazor offer components as pre-built packages that you include as dependencies. While this approach works, it presents several limitations:

- **Limited Customization**: You're often restricted to the styling options provided by the library.
- **Version Lock-in**: Updating the library might break your UI if component APIs change.
- **Black Box Development**: When issues occur, debugging becomes challenging as you can't easily inspect or modify the library's internals.
- **Learning Overhead**: Each library has its own patterns and conventions to learn.

### The Shadcn/ui inspiration

[Shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) has been the [top project](https://risingstars.js.org/2024/en#section-all) on JavaScript Rising Stars for two years runningâ€”and for good reason. It offers a unique approach: instead of installing a component library as a dependency, you copy and paste the actual component code into your project. You get complete control over customization, styling, and behavior, with components that feel like part of your project.

Pango takes total advantages of this concept:

- **Download, Don't Depend**: Instead of adding a package reference, you download only the components you need directly into your project.
- **Complete Ownership**: Once downloaded, these components are yours to customize, modify, and extend.
- **No Version Anxiety**: Since you own the component code, you're not affected by breaking changes in future releases.
- **Learn Once, Apply Anywhere**: The skills you develop working with Tailwind CSS and component patterns can be applied across different frameworks.

### Why Tailwind CSS?

Pango is built with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) v4 at its core, which offers significant advantages over traditional CSS frameworks like Bootstrap:

- **Utility-First**: Compose designs directly in your markup with utility classes.
- **Highly Customizable**: Tailor the design system to your brand through simple configuration.
- **Optimized**: Unlike Bootstrap where you need to import the whole library, Tailwind is compiled to a purely and compact CSS, resulting in better performance.
- **Perfect for Component Ownership**: Tailwind's utility classes make it easy to modify component styles without writing new CSS.

With Pango + Tailwind CSS, you can:

- Use `TailwindMerge.NET` for extending component designs
- Directly modify component internals when needed
- Create consistent UI patterns across your entire application
- Transfer your knowledge to other frameworks that use Tailwind (React, Vue, etc.)

## How Pango Works

Pango consists of two main projects:

### Pango CLI

The [Pango CLI](https://github.com/kallebysantos/pango) is a command-line tool that allows you to:

1. **Download components** from any Pango-compatible registry
2. **Create your own registry** of components
3. **Package and distribute** custom components for your team or the community

The CLI acts as the bridge between registries and your project, handling all the file operations needed to seamlessly integrate components into your codebase.

### Pango Registries

Registries are collections of components that follow the Pango specification. The main registry is [Pango UI](https://github.com/kallebysantos/pango-ui), but the architecture supports:

- **Community Registries**: Specialized component collections created by the community
- **Internal Registries**: Custom component sets maintained by teams for consistent branding
- **Framework-Specific Registries**: Components tailored for specific Blazor frameworks (Server, WebAssembly, MAUI)
